Expanding on the notes for creating the mysql database


= Details =

Have a look in "support/mysql scripts" for the sql scripts that will create the tables.
(NB. capitalized terms are replaced with whatever is in db.php

In mysql: 
  * create database dbname SEARCH_TERMS_DB;
  * use SEARCH_TERMS_DB;
  * source PATH/support/mysql scripts/search_terms.sql;
and do the same for the EMAIL_DB

create a user to access the databases and grant the privileges
  * create user 'DB_USER'@'DB_SERVER' identified by 'DB_PASSWORD';
  * grant all on SEARCH_TERMS_DB.`*` to 'DB_USER'@'DB_SERVER';
  * grant all on EMAIL_DB.`*` to 'DB_USER'@'DB_SERVER';
