= Introduction =

Welcome to SRUOpenSearch.  The original author of the project, All Hail, Paul the Wise, has moved on to other pastures.  There are a handful of us, so far, that find his code very useful, so you will be seeing a version 1.1 out around Easter 2011 adding in the features that we've managed to bolt on.  If you find it interesting too, to use or extend, please join us.

= An Apology =

This is my first Google Code project, so this will look rather shaky for a while as I don't have the time to come up to speed.


= Issues =

The first things we'd like to implement are:
  * Collection specifier in the config.php file (searches _all_ collections by default)
  * handling and displaying UTF8 characters (issue with the regex that untaints the input)

= Documents =

  * [Rebranding SRUOpenSearch]

= Details =

I'm leaving this here as a mnemonic, as it's just different enough from MediaWiki.  Format your content with:
  * Text in *bold* or _italic_
  * Headings, paragraphs, and lists
  * Automatic links to other wiki pages
